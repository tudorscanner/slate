# Flights Live Prices

The Live Pricing Service Session must be created before any pricing data can be obtained. The request contains details of the locations, dates, passengers, cabin class and user details. These parameters define the session, and cannot be changed within the session (with the exception of passenger numbers).

## Polling the booking details

### Request

```shell

<aside class="warning" name="booking-url-warning">
Previous versions of the Flights Pricing API returned the same polling URL as the URL used to request booking details.

This will change over the second half of 2018. We recommend you use the URL returned in the `Location` header and do not make assumptions on what the URL will be.

If you have a working integration with the Flights Pricing API and your integration is not reading the polling URL from the `Location` header, you will need to update your integration.

If you do not update your integration, polling the booking details for a session will fail at some point during the second half of 2018.
