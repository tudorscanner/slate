# Places

Places can be of 4 different types:

1. Country
2. City
3. Airport
4. Anywhere (flights browse API)

You can use any of the following endpoints to get information about places:

* our [Autosuggest](#list-of-places) endpoint to obtain a list of places and corresponding IDs that match a query string

* our [Autosuggest](#place-information) endpoint to get information about a specific place given its ID (for example, city name and country name for an airport)

* our [Geo catalog](#geo-catalog) to get the full list of places that we support (please [contact us](https://partners.skyscanner.net/contact/) to request access)

<aside class="warning">
The country and language must be included in the Autosuggest query so that the most relevant results can be returned in the correct language.

## Schemas

> Example place codes:

```shell
EDIN-sky
```
```shell
CDG-iata
```

Each place can be referred to via different schemas, described below.

*SCHEMAS*

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sky | Skyscanner code. The response from [Autosuggest](#place-information) provides these ids. |
| iata / iso | Airports and cities often use the internationally recognized IATA and ISO schemas.<br>For <b>Flights</b> we recommend that you use the Skyscanner code which is very similar but solves ambiguous cases where a city and one of its airports share the same code. |
| GeoNameCodes | GeoNameCodes from the GeoNames schema (see [geonames.org](www.geonames.org))|
| GeoNameIDs | GeoNameIDs from the GeoNames schema (see [geonames.org](www.geonames.org))|


If the default Skyscanner schema is not used, the schema name must be appended to the place id as follows:
`placeCode-locationSchema`
