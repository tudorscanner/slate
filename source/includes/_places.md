# Places

Places can be of 4 different types:

1. Country
2. City
3. Airport
4. Anywhere (flights browse API)

You can use any of the following endpoints to get information about places:

* our [Autosuggest](#list-of-places) endpoint to obtain a list of places and corresponding IDs that match a query string

* our [Autosuggest](#place-information) endpoint to get information about a specific place given its ID (for example city name and country name for an airport)

* our [Geo catalog](#geo-catalog) to get the full list of places that we support (please [contact us](https://partners.skyscanner.net/contact/) to request access)

<aside class="warning">
The country and language must be included in the Autosuggest query so that the most relevant results can be returned, in the correct language.

## Schemas

> Example place codes:

```shell
EDIN-sky
```
```shell
CDG-iata
```
```sell
-37.4849,144.5747-latlong
```

Each place can be referred to via different schemas, described below.

*SCHEMAS*

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sky | Skyscanner code. The response from [Autosuggest](#place-information) provides these ids. |
| iata / iso | Airports and cities often use the internationally recognized IATA and ISO schemas.<br>For <b>Flights</b> we recommend that you use the Skyscanner code which is very similar but solves ambiguous cases where a city and one of its airports share the same code. For <b>Car Hire</b> please use the IATA code.|
| latlong |	Latitude and longitude of the place in the following form: "latitude,longitude". The nearest city with airport will be used. |
| ip | IP of a user. The nearest city with airport will be used. Format: `188.39.95.93`|
| GeoNameCodes | GeoNameCodes from the GeoNames schema (see [geonames.org](www.geonames.org))|
| GeoNameIDs | GeoNameIDs from the GeoNames schema (see [geonames.org](www.geonames.org))|


If the default Skyscanner schema is not used, the schema name must be appended to the place id as follows:
`placeCode-locationSchema`

## Hotels Autosuggest

Retrieve a list of hotels and/or geographical locations which can then be used witht the hotels and car hire APIs. In the case of car hire, use this if you want downtown (non-airport) searches.

    market=US&
    locale=en-US
